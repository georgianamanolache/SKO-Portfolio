% \Cref{table:statistical_analysis_scores_different_groups}  and \Cref{table:statistical_analysis_scores_same_group} show the results of the statistical analyses tests performed in this study.
% First, a comparison between past \acrshort{ale} iteration was made to identify differences.
% \Cref{fig:distribution1820} shows the score distribution for pre-development course material student groups. 
% To satisfy the ANOVA independency condition, students which attended both \acrshort{ale}1 and \acrshort{ale}2 had their scores averaged, yielding to each group containing independent samples. 
% While data is normal, group 1920ss is positively skewed. 
% Assuming normality, with ANOVA the $p$-value is greater than 0.1. With Kruskal Wallis H-test the $p$-value also exceeds 0.1, thus, in conclusion, there is no statistical difference between the scores of previous \acrshort{ale} course iterations. The post-development group was also included and tested with ANOVA and Kruskal Wallis H. Similarly, student scores from group 22021fw were averaged to satisfy independency.\\\\
% %However, no significant difference was identified with the post-development comparison.\\\\
% %The paired t-test was conducted on the 22021fw which had both pre-development and post-development course material.[TODO]\\\\
% %\Cref{fig:distribution2021fw} shows the score distribution for the pre and post-development course material. [TODO]\\\\
% %This test yielded a $p<0.05$ which indicates that there is a significant difference between student performance with the new course material.
% %Looking at the distribution it is clear that 2021fw2 group performed better. \\\\
% Furthermore, there is not significant difference in the performance of past \acrshort{ale} student groups.
% \Cref{appendices:scores} describes a detailed study of the test group 1920ss for which the statistical analysis proved significant evidence in comparing \acrshort{ale}1 with \acrshort{ale}2 performance. For this group, although there seems to be a difference in performance, the performance in \acrshort{ale}2 is worse due to the introduction of weekly deadlines and mandatory feedback sessions. Moreover, having participated in the \acrshort{ale}1 course, the students should be familiar with the workload and requirements. However, while a few students score slightly better, majority seems to perform worse in \acrshort{ale}2. This may also be due to the fact that students usually join some electives to fill in missing \Gls{ec}s and deliver up to a passing grade. Thus, further research is required to assess student performance in both \acrshort{ALE} courses. Also, the study should be performed on larger groups, as the current test group was too formed of too little students.\\\\
% Unfortunately, the second part of the course had one student left for assessment. While several students joined in the beginning, majority dropped till the end, yielding a test group formed of 1 student that has followed both \acrshort{ale}1 and \acrshort{ale}2. Hence, the statistical testing could not be performed anymore for this test group.
