This study has presented an extensive analysis over the student performance influenced by course materials in the fourth year elective \acrshort{ale}. 
While there is not enough statistical significance to confirm that the performance was positively influenced due to redevelopment of course materials, there is a slight improvement. 
Further research is required to collect further statistical evidence from future \acrshort{ale} iterations. 
Regardless, course material should be continuously tailored to the students as it it the canvas to which scholars build their learning.
