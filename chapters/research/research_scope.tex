% Higher education institutions outside the university sector are known as \acrfull{uas}, which offer the highest level of professional education~\cite{lepori2010research}.
% Apart from curriculum development, \acrshort{uas} emphasise interactions with the professional field in the form of internships, study projects, thesis research and other means that stimulate knowledge exchange.
% Thus, the scope of research within \acrshort{uas} is not to form professional researchers, but to form professionals who can \textit{apply research} on practical problems. 
% Furthermore, application of research could lead to generation of new knowledge; thus, the research is often a mixture of \textit{applied} and \textit{practical}.
% At \acrshort{fhict} research is an integral part of the professional task, well integrated into all the four year bachelor's program curriculum, from the starting point when students get acquainted with research, to applying research to conduct an \acrshort{ict} project and deliver professional products as part of a graduation~\cite{FHICTResearch}.
% In essence, research is everywhere, not only in a research assignment.
