Developing testing materials throughout the redevelopment of \acrshort{ale} I learned about many new aspects that concern an assessment within~\acrshort{fhict}. First and foremost, I learned about the assessment policy~\cite{FHICTAssesmentPolicy}. While before I was only assuming what should be considered when developing and undertaking an assessment, learning about the \acrshort{fhict} assessment policy has made me a better assessor. Specifically, the policy provides a set of rules and regulations that must be followed to not only guarantee consistency but also quality of the assessment within the institute. Furthermore, the quality criteria described in the assessment policy helped me confirm the inconsistency of the previous \acrshort{ale} variant assessment, where assessment transparency was completely missing (e.i. students did not know how they were being scored and based on what learning outcomes).\\\\
