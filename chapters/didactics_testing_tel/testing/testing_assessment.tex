Although the course was held during the lockdown, the feedback was done online. I gave formative feedback to students remotely through online meetings or through \gls{canvas}. This is detailed in  \cref{chapter:tel}.
Formative feedback helps students in stirring progress in the right direction. The course assignments are rather complex and rarely the lessons and course material suffice in proper understanding for students~\cite{feedbackFHICT}. In fact students long for quick feedback on their work to reassure their work is not whitout success. While I strive to provide constructive feedback, this covers both positive and negative feedback. An example of formative feedback is shown in~\cref{appendices:feedback}.\\\\
Subsequently, summative feedback together with the assessments for the final project submitted at the end of the course helps students identify improvement points. Usually, assessment is less unexpected, as students are aware of their progress and improvements points throughout the course.
