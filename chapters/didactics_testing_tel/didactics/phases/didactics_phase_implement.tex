The redesigned course material was first offered in the second half of the Fall semester 2020-2021, specifically for \acrshort{ale}2 which is about the automata topic. 
Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, within \acrshort{fhict} the lessons were \textit{blended}: online and face-to-face. In fact, according to a study by~\citet{blended2013}, the combination of blended learning produces stronger student learning outcomes than learning solely through face-to-face instruction. Another advantage of the online education is the possibility to record the theory parts of the lessons and make them available for revision. Further description of the use of technology during COVID-19 is given in~\cref{chapter:tel}.
