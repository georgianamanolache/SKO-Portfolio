With over three years of experience within \acrshort{fhict}, currently performing full-time, I took the role of teacher, internship and project tutor, mentor, assessor and recently, incoming exchange students coordinator. 
I teach courses across all the four scholarly years mainly in the ICT \& Software Engineering profile (\cref{tel_face_to_face}, \ref{tel_blended}, \ref{chapter:testing_assessment}), however, I also get involved in courses that focus on improving students' soft skills (\cref{chapter:didactics_phase_design}). %\Cref{chapter:didactics} describes the course material development for an elective course I teach in the fourth year ICT \& Software Engineering, thus, giving an example of my teaching activity.
I have tutored students in their company internships (\cref{subsection:role_internship_assessor}) as well as in-house projects and have served as the mentor to start semester students since the implementation of the new curriculum (\cref{subsection:role_project_assessor}).  Although not having tutored graduation interns yet, I also took the role of second assessor for graduates (\cref{subsection:role_internship_assessor}). \\\\
%\Cref{chapter:research} gives several examples from these project assessment activities.\\\\
Apart from these regular didactic roles, I coordinate the incoming exchange students from their application process to mentoring during the exchange at \acrshort{fhict}. 
I had also voluntarily provided internship report writing sessions organized by the English stream student association Proxy at the students' request (\cref{appendices:volunteer}). Thus, I believe that the role that suits me best is tutoring, students always approaching me for advice, either technical or just personal.
Furthermore, I constantly explore opportunities to further enrich my technical and didactic skills and continuously improve.
