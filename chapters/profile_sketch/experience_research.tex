Throughout my education I have gained experience in both basic and applied research.
Basic or fundamental research is relating to pure mathematics.
The purpose of basic research is, thus, to acquire knowledge for the sake of theory and does not have immediate commercial objectives.
Especially during my master's thesis I carried out a study which ultimately outperformed the state-of-the-art, yielding to a publication\footnote{ 
\href{http://metalearning.ml/2019/}{Workshop on Meta-Learning (MetaLearn 2019) as part of NeurIPS 2019 (http://metalearning.ml/2019/)}}.\\\\
Applied research focuses on innovation and improvement on the basis of existing professional practice~\cite{FHICTResearch} and has specific commercial objectives.
As a \acrshort{fhict} alumna, I was already familiar with applied research. 
Every semester I supervise about four internship students with varying assignments. 
While I enjoy conducting research myself and plan to pursue a PhD career in the near future, I also find supervising interns enlightening.
