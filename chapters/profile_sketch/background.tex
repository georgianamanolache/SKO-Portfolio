As an international, I built my higher education in the Netherlands after graduating from the Mathematics profile at the National College Vasile Alecsandri, Galati, Romania. 
I successfully completed first the Bachelor's in ICT \& Software Engineering from \acrshort{fhict}, followed by the Master of Science in Data Science and Engineering from the Technical University of Eindhoven.\\\\
Aside of my regular studies, I started developing my career, from internships and working part-time as a software engineer, to participating and wining the Viral Award in the Fontys ICTalent Awards Fifth Edition\footnote{

Another achievement I pride myself with is the bachelor's graduation work where I developed a web real time communication prototype which to this day serves as a pilot in a hospital in Rome, Italy\footnote{

While my desire for knowledge has driven me towards exploring the domain of data within a master's degree, I had a genuine interest in education which ultimately lead me to joining \acrshort{fhict} as a part-time lecturer.
