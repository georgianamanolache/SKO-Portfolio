This portfolio demonstrates my professionalism at the \acrfull{fhict} enclosed in the form of \acrfull{sko} Didactics and Research portfolio~\cite{FKO} .\\\\
I composed this portfolio on the basis of my four years experience within \acrshort{fhict}, combining my findings and proposing new educational modules within the current educational context towards improving education in both didactics and research.
\\\\
%Apart from regular didactics, testing, \acrfull{tel} and research expertise, the course material development presented as part of the \acrshort{mko} Didactics is researched as part of the \acrshort{mko} Research to identify potential improvements in students performance, thus, my prime reason to combine the two \acrshort{mko} subjects.
%\\\\
%I would like to thank Eveline Roijmans, my \acrshort{mko} Didactics supervisor, for taking time to review the portfolio and providing valuable feedback. 
%I would also like to thank my \acrshort{mko} Research supervisor Vilma Lenselink for her guidance and stimulating questions about research and role as a research supervisor. 
%I am also thankful to my students for accommodating to the new teaching approach presented to them throughout my \acrshort{mko} development to which they provided immediate feedback. 
%\\\\
%I would like to thank No\"{e}lle van de Moosdijk, for supporting my development ideas.
%Finally, I am once again thankful to my family for being patient and supportive with my professional journey.
