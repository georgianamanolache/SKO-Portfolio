\chapter{Writing session (volunteer work) - some examples}\label{appendices:volunteer}
This section shows some materials I shared during the writing sessions I guided under the organisation of English stream student association Proxy. I composed several writing guidelines and exercise to practice report writing during the session and afterwords. The source I used for these materials is the Academic Writing for Graduate Students book by Christine B. Feak and John Swales.\\\\
